Create two overloaded methods for processing transaction. 
One that validates transaction date is not in the future (is before the current date) and only then 
adds transaction to the processed transactions. 
Second - takes transactionThreshold as a parameter and  adds transaction to the processed transactions only 
when transactionThreshold is less than 10.
